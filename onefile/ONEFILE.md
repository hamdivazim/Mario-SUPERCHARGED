# Mario SUPERCHARGED in a single file

I have also put all needed classes into one large file in case you need it. This will not be updated on _each_ commit to main but I will update it relatively pacy.
It is located at [__init__.py](https://github.com/hamdivazim/Mario-SUPERCHARGED/blob/onefile/onefile/__init__.py). Assets are [here](https://github.com/hamdivazim/Mario-SUPERCHARGED/tree/main/data/assets).
